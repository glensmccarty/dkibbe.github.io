<h1 id="welcome-to-cis126dl-00000-linux-operating-system-fall-2015">Welcome to CIS126DL (00000) Linux Operating System - Fall 2015</h1>

<p>Did you know that you use Linux every day without knowing it? Linux powers many of the most popular sites on the web including Google, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter and many, many others. If you own an Android phone, tablet or a Chromebook they are all based on Linux. Because of its open development model and modular construction Linux is at the forefront of innovation including the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/solutions/trends/iot">Internet of Things</a> overview.html.</p>



<h2 id="about-this-course">About This Course</h2>

<p>In this introductory course you will learn what Linux is, how to install Linux as a virtual machine on your current desktop and you will learn the basics of managing a Linux operating system. Linux skills are in <a href="http://www.datamation.com/careers/demand-for-linux-professionals-is-growing.html">high demand</a> throughout the IT industry. Many of the topics covered in this class will help prepare you for industry certifications such as the<a href="http://certification.comptia.org/getCertified/certifications/linux.aspx">CompTIA Linux+</a> and the <a href="http://www.lpi.org/linux-certifications">Linux Professional Institute LPIC-1</a>.</p>

<p>In this class you will be working with two popular Linux distributions <a href="http://centos.org/">CentOS</a> and <a href="http://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a>. CentOS is a community supported clone of <a href="http://redhat.com/">Red Hat Enterprise Linux</a> so you will gain experience working with one of the most common Linux distributions used in business. Ubuntu is a major Linux distribution popular on the desktop.</p>

<p>This is a hands-on course with approximately half the class time devoted to completing lab assignments. The class is taught using virtual machines running in <a href="http://virtualbox.org">VirtualBox</a>. VirtualBox runs Linux as if it were another Windows or Apple application with no need to partition or format your hard drive. VirtualBox is installed on all the workstations in the classroom as well as in the Open Entry Lab. VirtualBox is <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free/Open Source</a> software which you can download and install on your own computer. Many of the assignments can also be done using live media such as a bootable CD or USB.</p>

<p>This course is divided into 15 modules taught over 8 weeks, each module aligning with one or more official course competencies. You can find the <a href="http://www.maricopa.edu/curriculum/A-C/042cis126dl.html">official course description and competences</a>.</p>

<h2 id="course-policies">Course Policies</h2>



<h3 id="late-work-policy">Late Work Policy</h3>

<p>In general, late work is not accepted unless a legitimate unforeseen situation arises. To receive an extension, you are responsible for notifying me of your situation prior to a due date and receiving an email from me with an agreed upon extension.</p>



<h3 id="participation-drop-policy">Participation &amp; Drop Policy</h3>

<p>You will find your time in class more enjoyable and productive if you complete the assigned reading before coming to class. This will enable you to participate in classroom discussions and get more from classroom presentations. I structure the class so you have time in class to complete the required lab assignments. Many students find that they can leave class with the week’s lab work already completed if they use class time wisely.</p>

<p>As per college policies, you are expected to attend class. My expectation is that you come to class, log in to the course web site no less than twice a week and complete all assignments, discussions, quizzes, and projects by the deadlines. If you miss more than <em>two classes</em> you may be subject to being withdrawn from class at the discretion of the instructor. If you come to class prepared to participate and do the work you will do well in this class.</p>

<h3 id="community-ground-rules">Community Ground Rules</h3>

<p>Being a member of a learning community requires one to understand, accept, and model an important set of community groundrules. These groundrules will be in effect throughout our entire semester together. Each of us (myself included) is expected to uphold these groundrules. Please read them carefully and post any questions you have in the “Ask a Question” area of Blackboard. </p>
