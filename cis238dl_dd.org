#+TITLE:  Using the dd command to create a bootable USB Thumbdrive    
#+DATE:      
#+DESCRIPTION: EDIT ME!
#+KEYWORDS: EDIT!

* Assignment Objectives

  This assignment is based on Appendix A - Creating a Linux Installer on Flash/USB Device
  
  When you have successfully completed this assignment you will be able to:

  + Verify the integrity of a downloaded ISO using =sha1sum=.

  + Use =dmesg= to verify the exact assigned device for the USB device.

  + Use =dd= from the command line to create a bootable USB thumbdrive.

* Terms and Concepts

  + =dd= :: Used to copy data at a low level.

  + =df= :: Report file system disk space usage

  + =findfs= :: Find a filesystem by label or UUID.

  + /dev/sdx :: Hard drives in Linux are labeled /dev/sda. /dev/sdb, /dev/sdc, etc.

: Example: /dev/sdb1 (First partition on second drive)

  + Unetbootin :: Program to install Linux/BSD distributions to a partition or USB drive.

  + Fedora liveusb-creator ::  The liveusb-creator is a cross-platform tool for easily installing live operating systems on to USB flash drives.

  + Linux LiveUSB Creator :: LinuxLive USB Creator is a free and open-source software for Windows.

  + =wget= :: Utility to download files from the web.

  + =curl= :: Similar to wget

  + =dmesg= :: Print kernel messages

  + =sha1sum= :: Compute and check SHA1 message digest

  + Message Digest :: A cryptographic hash function that makes it easy to determine if a file has changed. 

  + =pinfo= :: Easy to use curses based lynx-style info browser

* Preparation

  *WARNING!:* The =dd= command is merciless it will overwrite all data on the device you specify.  No questions asked.  Disconnect all external devices and use =dmesg= to make certain you know what device you are writing to. 

* Create a bootable USB thumbdrive

** Download CentOS LiveCD ISO

   : jstudent@localhost:~/ $ wget -c http://mirrors.easynews.com//linux/centos/6.4/isos/x86_64/CentOS-6.4-x86_64-minimal.iso 

** Verify the download using =sha1sum=.

   :  jstudent@localhost:~/Dowloads$ sha1sum -c sha1sum.txt

** Identify the device to write to using =dmesg= and/or =findfs=.

*** Disable in BIOS

    This is always the safest.  At the least disconnect all external drives.

*** How hard drives are labeled in Linux

: Ex: /dev/sda2 (Second partition on first drive)

*** Write the data to the drive

: root@localhost: ~/Downloads# dd if=CentOS.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=4M

* What to Submit

  Copy and paste these questions along with your answers into the submission text-box (not the comment box) to receive credit for this assignment.

  1. Name an advantage of Ddrescue over dd.

  2. =/dev/sdc2= identifies what device?

  3. =dmeg= is useful because it prints out messages from the _________.

  4. Why is =dd= is useful for copying a Windows partition?

  5. Why do you need to be careful using =dd=?
