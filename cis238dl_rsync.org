* COMMENT

** TODO Add exclude by file type ISO.

* Overview

  Rsync is the basic tool for backing up files.  Many professional backup tools use it because of its very efficient algorithm.

* Assignment Objectives

  /When you have successfully completed this assignment you will be able to:/

  + Use =rsync= to backup files to another directory.

  + Use =rsync= to back up files to a remote host.

  + Create a custom exclude file.

  + Explain how Rsync handles excludes.

* Terms You Should Know

  + Rsync :: A fast, versatile, remote (and local) file-copying tool

  + -a :: Archive - Quick way to say use recursion and preserve almost everything.

  + -n :: Do a dry run.

  + -v :: Be verbose.

  + -l :: Follow symbolic links.

  + -P :: Show progress of individual files.

  + --exclude :: Excluded by pattern.

  + --exclude-from :: Use exclude file.

* Preparation

  You will run =rsync= from your workstation and will back up to a virtual machine.  If you can do the backups to a thumbdrive.

* Backup to a Local Folder

  The simplest way to back up is to back up to a local folder.

  1. Create a new folder.

     : mkdir -p ~/my_stuff/linux_distros/testdir/ ~/my_stuff/testdir

  2. Create some files to back up.

     : cd ~/my_stuff
     : for data in 1 2 3 4 5 6; do touch mydata-$data; done.
     : touch testdir/test{1,2,3}
     : touch linux_distros/testdir/test{A,B,C}

  3. Copy an ISO to =~/mystuff/linux_distros=.

  4. Change to you home directory and run a test backup.

     : rsync -avPn ~/my_stuff ~/my_backups

  5. Rsync will create the =my_backups= directory if it doesn't exist.

* COMMENT Follow Symbolic Links

  By default =rsync= does not copy files with symbolic links.  (It may look like it does here but that's because it's on the same file system.)  Adding the *-l* option causes linked files to be copied.

* Excluding Files From Backup

  You want to exclude the =~/my_stuff/linux_distros= from your backup since you can always download the ISOs again.  You can do that with the *--exclude* option.  You can use a file with the directories, files and patterns you want to exclude with *--exclude-from*.

  : rsync -avPn --exclude 'linux_distros' ~/my_stuff ~/my_backups

* Excluding Directories

  | Directory  | Results                     |
  |------------+-----------------------------|
  | testdir    | excl any testdir            |
  | testdir/   | excl any testdir            |
  | testdir/*  | incl testdir, excl contents |
  | /testdir   | incl testdir & contents     |
  | /testdir/* | incl testdir & contents     |
  
* Back Up to Remote Host

  Rsync can back up to a remote host using SSH.  In this example I'm backing up to the /testbackup/ directory in freeshell.org.  The colon (*:*) after the Freeshell.org URL tells rsync that this is a remote host.

  : rsync -avPe ssh --exclude 'linux_distros' my_stuff dennisk@freeshell.org:testbackup
