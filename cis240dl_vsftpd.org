* Overview

  FTP or File Transfer Protocol is one oldest protocols used on the Net.  (See the resources section for even older file transfer methods like Gopher.)  FTP uses two ports; *port 21* for control commands and *port 20* for the data itself.  The *vftpd* daemon is a popular FTP server for Linux.  In this assignment you will set up a FTP server for anonymous FTP.

  /After completing this assignment you will be able to:/

  1. Install the *vsftpd* daemon using *yum*.

  2. Configure vsFTPd for anonymous use.

  3. Create virtual FTP accounts.

  4. Deny and allow specific user access to FTP.

  5. Demonstrate how SELinux works to protect system files.

* Preparation

  You will need two user accounts for this assignment.  Create an account for =tux= and =jstudent=.  Be sure to assign a simple password to each account so you can remember it.

* How FTP works

** Active vs. Passive mode

*** Active Mode

    1. Client imitates data transfer to local unprivileged port.

    2. Server opens data connection from port 20 to client selected port.

*** Passive Mode

    1. Client asks server to listen on an unprivileged port of the server choice. Server responses with the high port it's listening on.

* Installing the Very Secure FTP Daemon

  vsFTP is in the CentOS official repos and can be installed with:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  # yum install vsftpd
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  The service must be started before it can be used and configured to start on reboot if desired.

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  # service vsftpd start
  # chkconfig vsftpd on
  #+END_EXAMPLE

* Configure =iptables=

  The standard ftp ports need to be opened in the firewall.  Do this using =system-config-firewall-tui=.

** TODO Add how to install =system-config-firewall-tui=.

* Configuration

  + =/usr/sbin/vsftpd= :: The Very Secure FTP Daemon

  + =/etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf= :: Main configuration file

  + =/etc/vsftpd/ftpusers= :: Lists users /not/ allowed to log into the FTP server

  + =/etc/vsftpd/userlist= :: Either allow or deny users depending on /userlist_deny/ in vsftpd.conf

  + =/var/ftp= :: FTP working directory

  + =/var/ftp/pub= :: Files for anonymous FTP access.

  /Note:/ when editing the =vsftpd.conf= file do not add spaces before or the equal sign (=).

* COMMENT Add section on logging Activate logging of uploads/downloads.

* Configure VSFTP For Anonymous Use

   1. First backup =/etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf=.

   2. Anonymous connections are allowed by default so you don't need to make any changes.

   3. Find the sections with the login banner string.

   4. Create a new FTP banner telling users that all activity on the server is logged.

   5. Place a test file in =/var/ftp/pub/=.

   6. From another workstation log in as /anonymous/ using your email address as the password and download the test file you created.  You can use the help command if you are new to ftp.

* Setting a Default Root Directory For anonymous Logins.

  The default login directory for /anonymous/ user is =/var/ftp/.  Next you'll change the default to =/var/ftp/pub/ by adding a new directive to the *vsftpd* configuration file.

  1. Add =anon_root=/var/ftp= below the line that allows /anonymous/ logins.

  2. Reload the configuration file.

* Allow Local Users To Use FTP.

  1. Uncomment /local_enable=YES/ to allow local user account to use FTP.

  2. The change won't be effective until you run =service vsftpd= reload.  This will cause *vsftpd* to reload its configuration file.

  3. On CentOS also need to configure SELinux.

     1. Check SELinux for ftp status with =getsebool -a | grep ftp=.

     2. Check if =ftp_home_dir â€“> on=.

     3. If it is not enabled change =setseboll -P ftp_home_dir on=.

     4. Local users are /chrooted/ to their home directory.

* Disable anonymous Logins

  Anonymous downloads are allowed by default. Next you'll disable anonymous logins.

  1. Change the line in the vsftpd.conf allowing anonymous logins from YES to NO.

  2. Reload the *vsftpd* daemon.

  3. Try to login as anonymous.

  4. The login should fail.

* Root login

  The =ftpusers= file lists accounts that are not permitted to use FTP.  The root user is included in this list.

  1. Try logging in as the root user.

  2. The login should fail and the attempt logged.

* Removing the ability of a user to use ftp.

  Even if local users are allowed to use ftp you can 'blacklist" a user by adding them to =ftpusers= or =??=.

** TODO =ftpusers= or =??=.

* SELinux (CentOS only)

1. Using the vsftpd server use *ls -Z* to display the SELinux contexts for the anaconda-ks.cfg file in root's home directory.

2. Next copy the anaconda-ks.cfg file to the /var/ftp/pub directory and display the SELinux contexts using *ls -lZ*.

3. Use the *chmod* command to add read permissions for all.

4. In Firefox open the anaconda-ks.cfg you copied to show that it is accessible by FTP.  Use the browser back button to return to the directory listing.

5. From the command line use *chcon* with the *--reference=* option to change the SELinux context of the anaconda-ks.cfg file in /var/ftp/pub directory to match that of the /root/anaconda-ks.cfg file.

6. Refresh the browser window and notice what happens.

7. Use the *restorecon -R* command to restore the correct SELinux context to the /var/ftp/pub directory and its contents.

8. Refresh the browser window and the file will be visible again..

* What To Submit

  Copy and paste these questions along with your answers into the text submission box.

  1. What directory do anonymous users log in to by default?

  2. What directive is used to set the default directory for anonymous logins to =/var/ftp/pub=?

  3. Create an account for another user and add them to \/etc\vsftpd/user_list.  Are they able to log in to the vsftpd server?

  4. Touch your test file.  What ftp command will retrieve the test file /only/ if it is newer than the previous download.

  5. Try accessing your ftp server from Firefox.  How must you enter the URL?

  6. Create a symbolic link in =/var/ftp/pub= to =/tmp=.  Login as anonymous and try to change to =/tmp= using the link. What happens?

  7. Login to ftp as a local user not in and type *pwd*.  What is the output and why?
