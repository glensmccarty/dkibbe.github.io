<h2 id="cis126dl-linux-operating-system">CIS126DL Linux Operating System</h2>

<p>Did you know that you use Linux every day without knowing it? Linux powers many of the most popular sites on the web including Google, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter and many, many others. If you own an Android phone, tablet or a Chromebook they are all based on Linux. Because of its open development model and modular construction Linux is at the forefront of innovation including the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/solutions/trends/iot">Internet of Things</a>.</p>



<h2 id="about-this-course">About This Course</h2>

<p>In this introductory course you will learn what Linux is, how to install Linux as a virtual machine and the basics of managing a Linux operating system. Linux skills are in <a href="http://www.datamation.com/careers/demand-for-linux-professionals-is-growing.html">high demand</a> throughout the IT industry. Many of the topics covered in this class will help prepare you for industry certifications such as the<a href="http://certification.comptia.org/getCertified/certifications/linux.aspx">CompTIA Linux+</a> and the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification/rhcsa">Red Hat RHCSA</a>.</p>

<p>In this class you will be working with two popular Linux distributions <a href="http://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> and  <a href="http://centos.org/">CentOS</a>. CentOS is a community supported clone of <a href="http://redhat.com/">Red Hat Enterprise Linux</a> so you will gain experience working with one of the most common Linux distributions used in business. Ubuntu is a major Linux distribution popular on the desktop.</p>

<p>This is a hands-on course with approximately half the class time devoted to completing lab assignments. The class is taught using virtual machines running in <a href="http://virtualbox.org">VirtualBox</a>. VirtualBox runs Linux as if it were another Windows or Apple application with no need to partition and format your hard drive. VirtualBox is installed on all the workstations in the classroom as well as in the Open Entry Lab. VirtualBox is <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free/Open Source</a> software which you can download and install on your own computer. Many of the assignments can also be done using live media such as a bootable DVD or USB. You will learn how to create this live media in this class.</p>

<p>This course is divided into 15 modules taught over 8 weeks, each module aligning with one or more <a href="http://www.maricopa.edu/curriculum/A-C/042cis126dl.html" title="Official Course Competencies">official course competencies</a>.</p>

The midterm and final exams count for 40 percent of your final grade.</p>

<h2 id="course-policies">Course Policies</h2>

<h3 id="community-ground-rules">Community Ground Rules</h3>

<p>Being a member of a learning community requires one to understand, accept, and model an important set of community ground rules. These ground rules will be in effect throughout our entire time together. Each of us (myself included) is expected to uphold these ground rules.</p>

<ol>
<li>Learning is a social activity and some of your best learning experiences will come from your fellow classmates. Come prepared to seek out those opportunities.</li>
<li>Your time in class is valuable. Side conversations and distracting behavior can make that time less productive. Please respect your fellow classmates.</li>
<li>Officially food and drinks are not permitted in any of the classrooms. However, if you must eat please avoid distracting those around you. </li>
<li>Come prepared and be ready to participate in class. this will make class more enjoyable for all.</li>
<li>It's important to be available to your family even when you are in class. But please limit cellphone activity to matters that can not wait.</li>
</ol>



<h3 id="class-participation-and-drop-policy">Class Participation and Drop Policy</h3>

<p>This is a hybrid class which means that in exchange for shorter class periods you are expected to do more of the work outside of class.</p>

<p>You will find your time in class more enjoyable and productive if you complete the assigned reading <em>before</em> coming to class. This will enable you to participate in classroom discussions and get more from classroom presentations. I structure the class so you have time in class to complete the required lab assignments. Many students find that they can leave class with the week's lab work already completed if they use class time wisely.</p>

<p>As per college policies, you are expected to attend class. My expectation is that you come to each class, log in to the Canvas no less than twice a week and complete all assignments, discussions, quizzes, and projects by the deadlines posted in Canvas. <em>If you miss more than two class periods you are subject to being withdrawn from class at the discretion of the instructor.</em> If you come to class prepared to participate and do the work you will do well in this class.</p>
