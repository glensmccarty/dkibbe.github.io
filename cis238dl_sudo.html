<h2 id="using-su-and-sudo-to-get-work-done-as-root">Using <code>su</code> and <code>sudo</code> to Get Work Done as Root</h2>

<p>Both <code>su</code> and <code>sudo</code> can be used to work as the root user. Some distributions like Ubuntu disable the root account by default and all work is done using the <code>sudo</code> command. Even on distributions like Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS <code>sudo</code> can be used to delegate root privileges to ordinary users. <code>sudo</code> is similar to <em>run as</em> on Windows.</p>

<h2 id="assignment-objectives">Assignment Objectives</h2>

<p><em>After successfully completing this assignment you will be able to:</em> </p>

<ol>
<li>Use the <code>su</code> command to log in as the root user.</li>

</ol>

<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>

<p>Do this assignment on the CentOS 7 virtual machine after creating accounts for <code>trillian</code> and <code>jstudent</code>.</p>

<h2 id="install-mutt">Install Mutt</h2>

<p>Mutt is a command line mail client. Install it using <code>yum</code>. You can use Mutt to read email messages that Sudo sends to root.</p>



<h3 id="virtual-terminals">Virtual Terminals</h3>

<p>In this assignment you will be working with two virtual terminals. If you are working from a LiveCD you access virtual terminals with the key combination <strong>Crtl+Alt+Fn1</strong> through <strong>Ctrl+Alt+Fn6</strong> and return to the graphical display with <strong>Ctrl+Alt+Fn7</strong>. (* Note:*  some distributions put the GUI on <strong>Ctrl+Alt+Fn1</strong> instead of Ctrl+Alt+Fn7*.). The virtual terminals live outside of the GUI and are useful for troubleshooting when some run away program has turned the graphical display to molasses.</p>

<p>In VirtualBox you will use the <strong>host</strong> plus a function key to access virtual terminals. The default setting for the <strong>host</strong> key is the right control key.</p>

<h2 id="the-su-command">The <code>su</code> Command</h2>

<p>The <code>su</code> command lets you become the root user or another user if you have the password for that account. Using the <strong>-</strong> (dash) option gives the full environment including the correct PATH environmental variable so commands work correctly. Always use the dash or you may have problems doing some things as root.</p>

<h2 id="the-sudo-command">The <code>sudo</code> Command</h2>

<p>A disadvantage to using <code>su</code> to allow users to run commands as root is that you must give them the root password and you can’t easily limit what they can do. Also, you don’t know who (as root) actually ran the command. The <code>sudo</code> command lets you give users in the <em>sudoers</em> file specific root privileges without the need to give them the root password. Their actions are logged as well so you have a record of what each user did.</p>

<p>The <code>/etc/sudoers</code> file is edited with the special program <code>visudo</code>. The <code>visudo</code> command creates a temporary copy of the sudoers file for editing and verifies that any changes have the correct syntax before saving changes to <code>/etc/sudoers</code>. As you may have guessed by the name <code>visudo</code> uses the <code>vi</code> text editor or the default editor.</p>

<h2 id="enabling-the-wheel-group-in-the-sudoers-file">Enabling the wheel group in the sudoers file</h2>

<p>User <code>trillian</code> should already be a member of the <em>wheel</em>  group from a previous assignment.  If you need to add <code>trillian</code> to the <em>wheel</em> group. log Trillian out and then back in for the changed to become active. The <em>wheel</em>  group is a standard Linux/Unix group.</p>

<p>Use <code>visudo</code> to edit the <strong>/etc/sudoers</strong>. <code>visudo</code> will automatically open the correct file and lock it so no other user can edit it.</p>

<p>If this line is uncommented in the sudoers file users who are members of the * wheel*  group can run all commands. Remove the <strong>#</strong> character before <strong>%wheel</strong> to make the line active.</p>

<h2 id="using-sudo">Using sudo</h2>

<p>Log in as <code>trillian</code> on another virtual terminal (host+Fn2) and run this command:</p>

<pre><code>$ less /var/log/secure
</code></pre>

<p>Since log files can only be read with root privileges the command will fail. Now try the command with <code>sudo</code>.</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo less /var/log/secure
</code></pre>

<p>You’ll be asked for Trillian’s password and the command will work.</p>

<h2 id="logging">Logging</h2>

<p>All activity of sudoers is logged in <strong>/var/log/secure</strong> on CentOS or <strong>/var/log/audit/audit.log</strong> on Debian. View the end of the log with the <code>tail</code> command and you’ll see the commands run by <code>trillian</code> was logged.</p>

<p><em>Sudo logs the following information:</em> </p>

<ul>
<li>The command executed.</li>
<li>Who ran the command.</li>
<li>Which host the command ran on.</li>
<li>When the command was executed.</li>
<li>The directory from which the command was executed.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="in-etcsudoers">In /etc/sudoers</h3>

<p>Root will still be logged in on virtual terminal 1 (TTY1) so type the <em>host</em> key plus F1 to return there and use <code>visudo</code> to add the comment character back to disable the * wheel*  group having root privileges.</p>

<p>Go back to Trillian’s login screen and try the <code>sudo</code> command again. The command will fail since members of the <em>wheel</em>  group are no longer permitted <code>sudo</code> privileges. This “Sudo Incident” will be logged as well. In addition, root will receive an email reporting the “incident.” Use can use <code>mutt</code> to see the email.</p>

<h3 id="removing-trillian-from-the-wheel-group">Removing Trillian From the Wheel Group</h3>

<p>You use the <code>usermod</code> command to remove Trillian from the <em>wheel</em>  group. When you added Trillian to the <em>wheel</em>  group the <strong>-a</strong> option appended the <em>wheel</em>  group to Trillian’s supplementary groups. Omitting the <strong>-a</strong> removes Trillian from the group.</p>

<h2 id="the-etcsudoersd-directory">The /etc/sudoers.d/ Directory</h2>

<p>If the sudoers file includes an <code>includedir</code> directive you can add files to that directory rather than editing the sudoers file directly. This is preferred since it keeps the original file closer to its original state. You should use <code>visudo -f</code> to edit the file so the syntax will be checked when you save the file.</p>

<p><em>Here is an example:</em> </p>

<h2 id="example-etcsudoers-entries">Example <code>/etc/sudoers</code> entries</h2>

<p>This entry in <strong>01_jstudent</strong> the user <code>jstudent</code> will be able to read the kernel messages log:</p>

<pre><code>$
</code></pre>

<p>This entry would let <code>jstudent</code> update the locate database using the alias to the <code>updatedb</code> command in the sudoers file.</p>

<pre><code>$
</code></pre>

<p>See the <code>sudoers</code> man page for details.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshoot-the-assignment">Troubleshoot the Assignment</h2>

<ul>
<li>Make sure that user <code>trillian</code> is a member of the <em>wheel</em>  group.</li>
<li>If the <code>groups</code> command doesn’t show the wheel group. Log Trillian out than back in.</li>
<li>Sudoers use their own password and not the root password.</li>
</ul>
