* Assignment Objectives

  FTP or File Transfer Protocol is one of the oldest protocols used on the Net.  Before there was Dropbox or Google Drive files were shared using the File Transfer Protocol

  /After You have successfully completed this assignment you will be able to:/

  1. Install the vsFTPd daemon (server)
  2. Install the FTP client.
  3. Create virtual FTP accounts.
  4. Deny and allow specific users access to FTP.
  5. Add a login banner.
  6. Demonstrate how SELinux works to protect system files.

* Terms and Commands You Should Know

  - FTP :: File Transfer Protocol
  - /usr/sbin/vsftpd :: The Very Secure FTP server
  - /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf :: Main configuration file for vsftp.
  - /etc/vsftpd/ftpusers :: Lists users not allowed to log into the FTP server.
  - /etc/vsftpd/user\_list :: Either allow or deny users depending on userlist\_deny in vsftpd.conf.
  - /var/ftp- FTP working directory
  - /var/ftp/pub :: Directory for anonymous FTP access.

* Preparation

  1. Start a CentOS 7 virtual machine by importing the centos7.ova.
  2. Make sure the virtual machine is on the 192.168.201.0/24 network.
  3. Create a snapshot of the virtual machine so you can roll back any errors.
  4. You can find the most up to date version of this assignment on [[http://dennisk.freeshell.org/][my web site]].

* How FTP works

** Active vs. Passive mode

*** Active Mode

    1. Client initiates data transfer to local unprivileged (greater than 1023) port.
    2. Server opens data connection from port 20 to client's selected port.

*** Passive Mode

    1. Client asks server to listen on an unprivileged port of the server’s choice. Server responses with the high port it’s listening on.

* Install the Very Secure FTP server and FTP client

  vsFTPd is in the CentOS official repository and can be installed using Yum.  The FTP client is not installed by default and can be installed at the same time as the server.

  : # yum install vsftpd ftp

* Starting the Service

  The service must be started before it can be used.  CentOS 7 uses systemd so the commands are different that CentOS 6.

  : # systemctl start vsftpd.service

  You can check if the server is running with this command.

  : # systemctl status vsftpd.service

  To make sure the service starts on reboot.

  : # systemctl enable vsftpd

* Using FTP

  Open a terminal and type ~ftp~ to start an FTP session.

  : $ ftp> open ftp.freebsd.org
  : Connected to ftp.geo.freebsd.org.
  : 220 This is ftp0.nyi.freebsd.org - hosted a t NYI.net.

  You will as anonymous (No not that Anonymous).  There is no password but as a courtesy you could enter your email address.  Once logged in you can type help for a list of commands. M any shell commands like ls and cd work as you expect.  Change to the pub directory then the FreeBSD directory.  Use get to fetch the README.TXT file to your local current directory.  Type exit to close the connection.

* Configure the Firewall

  Use ~yum install firewalld~ if needed than

  : # systemctl start firewalld.service
  : # systemctl enable firewalld.service

  Next add the default port for FTP.

  : # firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service ftp
  : # firewall-cmd --permanent --list-services

  You should see the service enable in the firewall.

* Using FTP

  Open a terminal and type ftp to start an FTP session.

  : $ ftp> open ftp.freebsd.org
  : Connected to ftp.geo.freebsd.org.
  : 220 This is ftp0.nyi.freebsd.org - hosted a t NYI.net.

  You will as anonymous (No not that anonymous).  There is no password but as a courtesy you could enter your email address.  Once logged in you can type help for a list of commands. M any shell commands like ls and cd work as you expect.  Change to the pub directory then the FreeBSD directory.  Use get to fetch the README.TXT file to your local current directory.  Type exit to close the connection.

* FTP Banner

  First make a backup of the vsftpd main configuration file to root's home directory.

  : # cp /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf ~/vsftpd.conf.bak

  Find the section with the login banner string and edit it to create a new FTP banner warning users that all activity on the server is logged.

* Adding a File to the FTP Directory

  Change to =/var/ftp= and create a new file.

  : # cd /var/ftp
  : # touch hello.txt

* Use FTP to access the file

  Open a new virtual terminal by pressing the host key (right Ctrl plus F2) and log in as user Tux.

  Start the FTP client and try to open a connection to localhost .

  : # ftp
  : ftp> open localhost

    Login as user anonymous with no password. You can than type help to get a list of commands.  Refer to the FTP beginner’s guide under Resources below.

* Setting a Different Root Directory For anonymous Logins

  The default login directory for anonymous user is =/var/ftp/=. Next you'll change the default to =/var/ftp/pub/= by adding a new directive to the vsftpd configuration file.

  1. Add anon\_root=/var/ftp/pub below the line that allows anonymous logins.
  2. Close the connection as anonymous.
  3. Place a file in /var/ftp/pub.
  4. Open the connection again as anonymous.
  5. Use ls to show that you are in the directory containing your test file. An anonymous user has no access to a higher directory.

* Disable anonymous Logins

  Anonymous logins are allowed by default. Next you'll disable anonymous logins.

  1. Change the line in the vsftpd.conf allowing anonymous logins from YES to NO.
  2. Restart the vsFTPd daemon.
  3. Try to login as anonymous.
  4. The login should fail.

* Root login

  The ftpusers file lists accounts that are not permitted to use FTP.  The root user is included in this list.
  
  1. Try logging in as the root user.
  2. The login should fail and the attempt logged.

* Disable FTP for a User

  Even if local users are allowed to use FTP you can blacklist a user by adding them to =ftpusers= or =user\_list=.  See the comments in these files to see which takes priority.

* SELinux

  This part of the assignment will demonstrate how SELinux steps in to prevent vsFTP from serving a mislabeled file.

* Create Files

  In root’s home directory is a kickstart configuration file.  First you will copy this file to two new files than copy and move the files to /var/ftp/pub

  : # ls 
  : anaconda-ks.cfg
  : # cp anaconda-ks.cfg anaconda-ks.cfg.copy
  : # cp anaconda-ks.cfg anaconda-ks.cfg.move

* Check the SELinux Security Context

  Use the ~ls -Z~ command to list the SELinux

  : # ls -Z anaconda*

  All three files have the same security context - admin\_home\_t.

* Copy and Move the files

  Use the cp command to copy anaconda-ks.cfg.copy to/var/ftp/pub`

  : #  cp anaconda-ks.cfg.copy /var/ftp/pub/

  and the mv command to move anaconda-ks.cfg.move to /var/ftp/pub

  : # mv anaconda-ks.cfg.move /var/ftp/pub

* Use FTP to list the files

  Use the FTP client to login as anonymous and list the files in the pub directory.  anacond-ks-cfg.move is missing.

* Change the permissions

  Use chmod to change the permissions on anaconda-ks.cfg.move to 066. Everyone should be able to read the files but they can’t.  SELinux has stepped in to block vsFTP from serving the file because the security context is wrong. Use the following command to show that anaconda-ks.cfg.move has the wrong security context.

  : # cd /var/ftp/pub
  : ls -lZ

* Restoring the correct security context

  Use restorecon restores the correct security context to all files based on the security context of the directory they are in.

  : # ls -ldZ /var/ftp/pub

  shows that the correct security context for files in this directory is public_content_t.

  : # ls -lZ /var/ftp/pub/*

* SELinux

  SELinux has stepped in to prevent vsFTP from serving a mis-configured file.

  Run getenforce to show that SELinux is in enforcing mode.  Next put SELinux in permissive mode.

  : # setenforce 0

  Refresh the listing and anaconda-ks.cfg.move now shows up.

* Correcting a Mis-configured File

  The most common problem is moving a file rather than copying a file. Moved files retain the original security context. Next you’ll use SELinux tools to fix the problem.

* Restoring the Correct Security Contexts

  The restorecon tool will restore the correct contexts for all files in a directory.

  : # restorecon -r /var/ftp/*

* Change the Security Context of a File

  Another tool chcon can be used to manually configure the security contexts of a file.  You can use the –reference= option to copy the security contexts from another file.

* COMMENT On Your Own

* COMMENT Common Mistakes

* What to Submit

  Submit a screenshot of ls -lZ /var/ftp/pub/* showing that each file has the correct security context.
