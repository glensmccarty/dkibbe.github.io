** TODO Quizzes

   Each week there is a quiz worth 10 points covering that week's work due before the first class session of the following week.  Quizzes not submitted by the due date will receive a grade of 0 and can not be made up.  Quizzes count for 20 percent of your final grade.

** TODO Midterm and Final Exams

   The midterm and the final exams are taken in class.  If you have a documented reason why you cannot be in class for these exams you can schedule to take a makeup exam within 48 hours of the due date otherwise you will receive a grade of 0 on the exam.  I understand that to receive a final grade of C or better I must score at least 60% on the final exam. The midterm and final exams count for 40 percent of your final grade.

** TODO Assignments and Discussions

   There is an assignment or discussion each week due the following week.  Late assignments lose 20 percent of the total point value unless you have a documented reason why the assignment could not be turned in on time.  Assignments and Discussions count for 30 percent of your final grade.

** TODO Attendance

   See Class Participation and Drop Policy below.  Attendance counts for 10 percent of your final grade.

** COMMENT Extra Credit

   Participating in the local Linux community or in a Free/Open Source project can earn you up to 10 percent of your final grade.

* Course Policies

** Community Ground Rules

   Being a member of a learning community requires one to understand, accept, and model an important set of community ground rules.  These ground rules will be in effect throughout our entire time together.  Each of us (myself included) is expected to uphold these ground rules.  Learning is a social activity and some of your best learning experiences will come from your fellow classmates.  Come prepared to seek out those opportunities.  Your time in class is valuable.  Side conversations and distracting behavior can make that time less productive.  Please respect your fellow classmates.  Officially food and drinks are not permitted in any of the classrooms.  However, if you must eat please avoid distracting those around you.  Come prepared and be ready to participate in class.  this will make class more enjoyable for all.  It's important to be available to your family even when you are in class.  But please limit cellphone activity to matters that can not wait.

* Class Participation and Drop Policy

  This is a hybrid class which means that in exchange for shorter class periods you are expected to do more of the work outside of class.  You will find your time in class more enjoyable and productive if you complete the assigned reading before coming to class.  This will enable you to participate in classroom discussions and get more from classroom presentations.  I structure the class so you have time in class to complete the required lab assignments.  Many students find that they can leave class with the week's lab work already completed if they use class time wisely.  As per college policies, you are expected to attend class.  My expectation is that you come to each class, log in to the Canvas no less than twice a week and complete all assignments, discussions, quizzes, and projects by the deadlines posted in Canvas.  If you miss more than two class periods you are subject to being withdrawn from class at the discretion of the instructor.  If you come to class prepared to participate and do the work you will do well in this class.

** Student Responsibilities

   As a student at MCC you are responsible for understanding and following the policies in the college catalog and student handbook.

** Services for Students that Require Special Accommodations

   Students with disabilities must have an equally effective and equivalent educational opportunity as those students without disabilities.  Students experiencing difficulty accessing course materials because of a disability are expected to contact the course instructor so that a solution can be found that provides all students equal access to course materials and technology.  If you have a documented disability, including a learning disability, and would like to discuss possible accommodations, please contact the MCC Disabilities Resources and Services (DRS) office at 480-461-7447 or drsfrontdesk@mesacc.edu.

* Changes to this Course

  Changes may be made to assignments, due dates and such during the course.  Students will be notified by the instructor of any changes in course requirements or policies.
