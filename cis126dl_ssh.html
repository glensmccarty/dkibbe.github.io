<h2 id="using-ssh-for-remote-connections">Using SSH for remote connections</h2>

<p>The suite of tools that make up the OpenSSH package replace <code>telnet</code>, <code>ftp</code> and rtools for connecting over insecure networks. Secure Shell or SSH, as we know it creates a secure end-to-end tunnel using strong encryption.</p>

<p>In this assignment you’ll use <code>ssh</code>, <code>scp</code> and <code>sftp</code> to connect to another workstation and transfer files.</p>

<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>

<p>On later versions of CentOS and Ubuntu OpenSSH server is installed and running so you may not need to install the service.</p>

<p>In this assignment you will be working with another student. Setup Ubuntu as the SSH client and CentOS as the SSH server.</p>



<h3 id="bridging-the-network">Bridging the Network</h3>

<p>Both hosts need to be on the same network and have different IP addresses. Before starting the CentOS minimum virtual machine set networking in VirtualBox to bridging and under Advanced refresh the MAC address.:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/CIS126DL/Images/vbox_bridged.png" alt="Network bridge settings in VirtualBox" title="Network bridge setting in VirtualBox"></p>



<h3 id="check-that-the-host-is-reachable">Check that the Host is Reachable</h3>

<p>Make note of the IP address of the virtual machine. You’ll use the IP address to connect to the virtual machine.</p>



<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-bash hljs ">$ ip addr show</code></pre>

<p>Check that you can reach the virtual machine on the network. The virtual machine must have an IP address on the 192.168.201.0/24 network. For example:</p>



<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-bash hljs ">$ ping <span class="hljs-number">192.168</span>.<span class="hljs-number">201.106</span> -c4</code></pre>



<h3 id="hostname">Hostname</h3>

<p>If you are using two CentOS VM’s changing the <strong>hostname</strong> on the server will make easier to know when you are loginto the server.</p>



<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-bash hljs "><span class="hljs-comment"># hostname set-hostname ssh-server</span></code></pre>

<h3 id="create-an-account-on-the-host">Create an Account on the Host</h3>

<p>To complete this lab you’ll need to work with another student or have two VMs running on two workstations.</p>

<p>Create user <em>jstudent</em> on the client and user <em>tux</em> on the server.</p>

<h4 id="centos">CentOS</h4>



<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-bash hljs "><span class="hljs-comment"># useradd -m -c "Jack Student" jstudent</span>

<span class="hljs-comment"># passwd jstudent</span></code></pre>

<h4 id="ubuntu">Ubuntu</h4>

<p>You can use the <em>Tux</em> user on Ubuntu or</p>

<h3 id="openssh-server">OpenSSH Server</h3>

<p>Both the OpenSSH client and server should already be installed but the server may need to be started. Check with the <strong>status</strong> option then use the <strong>start</strong> option if needed.</p>



<h4 id="centos-1">CentOS</h4>



<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-bash hljs "><span class="hljs-comment"># systemctl status sshd.service</span></code></pre>

<p>The SSH server listens on port 22. You can use <code>netstat</code> on the server virtual machine to confirm that the SSH server is listening on port 22.</p>



<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-bash hljs "><span class="hljs-comment"># netstat -luntp</span></code></pre>



<h3 id="firewall">Firewall</h3>

<p>Install <strong>firewalld</strong> on the server and add <strong>ssh</strong> to the list of trusted services.</p>

<p>See the Digital Ocean link under resources for a  tutorial</p>

<h2 id="use-ssh-to-login">Use SSH to Login</h2>

<p>Once the SSH server is started and port 22 is open in the firewall you can log into the remote host from a shell on your local machine using the login name and password on the remote host. To log into the remote computer use this command and substitute your user name and the IP address of the virtual machine you wish to log into.</p>

<p>Use <code>ssh</code> to login:</p>



<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-bash hljs ">$ ssh user@remote</code></pre>

<p>You can omit the user name if it’s the same as the local user.</p>

<p>The first time you connect you will be presented with the fingerprint of the server to confirm you are connecting to the correct host. After giving the password for the remote account you will be logged into the remote machine. To close the connection type <code>exit</code> and you will be returned to your own virtual machine.</p>



<h2 id="secure-ftp">Secure FTP</h2>

<p>The secure FTP command is used to transfer files to and from the remote host.</p>

<p>Copy the <em>copyright</em> file in <em>/usr/share/doc/bash/</em> to your home directory than connect using <code>sftp</code></p>



<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-bash hljs ">$ sftp -i .ssh/id_rsa jstudent@<span class="hljs-number">192.168</span>.<span class="hljs-number">201.106</span></code></pre>

<p>You will now have a new prompt and be connectied to the remote host. The <strong>help</strong> command lists the commands available</p>

<p>The <strong>put</strong> command will upload <em>copyright</em> on your local machine to the remote host.</p>



<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-bash hljs ">sftp&gt; put copyright
Uploading copyright</code></pre>

<p>Use the <strong>bye</strong> command to close the connection.</p>



<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-bash hljs ">sftp&gt; bye</code></pre>



<h2 id="secure-copy">Secure Copy</h2>

<p>Secure Copy can be used to copy a single file to the remote host or download a single file. The syntax is the came as the <strong>cp</strong> command with one important difference – a trailing semi-colon (<strong>;</strong>) tell the shell that this is a remote host.</p>

<p>Delete <em>copyright</em> from the local directory then download the copy from the server.</p>



<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-bash hljs ">$ scp jstudent@<span class="hljs-number">192.168</span>.<span class="hljs-number">201.106</span>:copyright .</code></pre>

<p>The final period (<strong>.</strong>) represent the current directory.</p>



<h2 id="using-ssh-with-public-key-authorization">Using SSH with Public Key Authorization</h2>

<p>Public key authorization is more secure that using a password and more convenient. To use public key authorization you create a key pair on your local machine and then upload the <em>public key</em> to the remote host. The <em>private key</em> stays on the local machine and is protected by a passphrase.</p>

<p>First generate a public/private key pair on the localhost. The password protects the private key from unauthorized use. Later in this assignment you will configure ssh-agent so you do not have to enter the password each time. The ssh-keygen command suggests a default key pair name but you can use a more descriptive name if you like. Be sure to enter the complete path to your .ssh directory.</p>

<p>You should not create the keys as root!</p>



<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-bash hljs ">$ ssh-keygen <span class="hljs-operator">-f</span> tux_rsa
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> which to save the key (/home/jstudent/.ssh/id_rsa):

+-----------------+</span></code></pre>

<p>The <em>randomart</em> serves the same purpose as the artwork you may have selected when you set up online access to your bank account. It helps assure you are connected to the correct host.</p>



<h2 id="placing-the-public-key-on-the-remote-host">Placing the Public Key on the Remote Host</h2>

<p>Before you can use the keys the public key must be appended to <em>~.ssh/authorized_keys</em> on the remote host. You will use <code>ssh-copy-id</code> to copy the <em>public key</em> to the remote host.</p>



<h2 id="ssh-copy-id">ssh-copy-id</h2>

<p>The <code>ssh-copy-id</code> command makes the task of uploading the public key easy.</p>



<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-bash hljs ">$ ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/id_rsa.pub jstudent@<span class="hljs-number">192.168</span>.<span class="hljs-number">201.106</span></code></pre>



<h2 id="connecting-using-publicprivate-keys">Connecting Using Public/Private Keys</h2>

<p>Now that you have the public key added to <em>authorized_keys</em> on the virtual machine you can connect using the private key.</p>



<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-bash hljs ">$ ssh -i .ssh/id_rsa jstudent@<span class="hljs-number">192.168</span>.<span class="hljs-number">201.106</span></code></pre>

<p>If you used a passphrase to protect the private you will need to enter it. If not after a short wait you should see the shell prompt on the virtual machine.</p>



<h2 id="ssh-agent-and-key-chain">SSH Agent and Key Chain</h2>

<p>The <code>ssh-agent</code> command caches the private key passphrase so you only need to enter it once per session. Refer to this <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-keyc/index.html" title="Setting up SSH Agent">IBM developerworks</a> tutorial on setting up SSH-Agent and key chain.</p>



<h2 id="the-ssh-client-configuration">The SSH Client Configuration</h2>

<p>The global SSH client file is <em>/etc/ssh/ssh_config</em> (<em>Do not edit this file.*and each user can have a local configuration file named *config</em> in that user’s <em>~/.ssh</em> directory. The customizations make it easy to log in to multiple hosts. Here is an example from my <em>config</em>:</p>



<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-bash hljs ">Host ironman
    HostName <span class="hljs-number">72.208</span>.<span class="hljs-number">176.109</span>
    Port <span class="hljs-number">4444</span>
    User profx
    PubkeyAuthentication yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/srv.rsa</code></pre>

<p>Create your own <em>config</em> file (<em>Note:</em> Do not edit the file in the etc/ directory.) using mine as a template. Be sure the change the <em>Host</em>, <em>HostName</em>, <em>Port</em>, <em>User</em> and <em>IdentityFile</em>.</p>

<p>*With this entry you just need to type  <code>ssh</code> plus the Host name you chose to connect to the host.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshot-the-assignment">Troubleshot the Assignment</h2>

<ul>
<li>Make sure you are logged into the correct computer before you run a command.</li>
<li>For a successful SSH connection several things are needed.</li>
<li>The virtual machine must have a IP address on the same network as the workstation.</li>
<li>There must be an opening on the firewall of the virtual machine for port 22.</li>
<li>The SSH daemon must be running on the virtual machine.</li>
<li>The correct permissions on the different files are important. If after creating the public/private keys you are still asked for a password to log in or Secure Shell refuses to connect that a either the private key or <em>authorized_keys</em> has the wrong permissions.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="what-to-submit">What to Submit</h2>

<p>Submit a screenshot of the ~/.ssh/config file you created to automate login to the virtual machine. For full credit include the two lines that show that public key encryption is being used to login.</p>
