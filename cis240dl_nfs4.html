<p>In this assignment you will set up a NFS server for another team to connect to and they will do the same for your team. Both machines must be on the 1.92.168.201.0/24 network and have unique IP addresses.</p>

<p>In VirtualBox set networking to <em>Bridged Adapter</em> and make sure <em>Connect the cable</em> is checked.</p>

<h2 id="configure-the-nfs-server">Configure the NFS Server</h2>

<p>Follow the instructions Chapter 4 to set up the server which should be on Fedora 7.</p>

<h2 id="configure-the-nfs-client">Configure the NFS Client</h2>

<p>Set up the client following the instructions in Chapter 4 on either Ubuntu or Fedora. You will edit the <code>/etc/fstab</code> file to make the share available on boot.</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure both virtual machines are on the same network and can ping each other.</li>
<li>Create a file so you can see that the directory is mounted properly.</li>
<li>Use <code>nmap</code> from the client to map open ports on the NFS server. </li>
<li>Port 2049 needs to be open on the server.</li>
<li>Make sure you are using the correct IP addresses for your NFS server and the subnet you are on.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-to-submit">What to Submit</h2>

<p>Submit a screenshot of the <code>mount | grep nfs</code> command on the client showing that the share is mounted.</p>
