* Overview

* Assignment Objectives

In this assignment you will find and install the =htop= process viewer.  =htop= is an improved version of =top=.

/After completing this assignment you will be able to:/

- Find a package using apt-cache.
- Obtain additional information on a package.
- Install a package using =apt-get.=
- Find the version of a package.
- Remove a package.

* Terms and Commands You Should Know

- APT :: Debian's Advanced Package Tool
- apt-cache :: Query the APT cache
- apt-get :: APT package handling utility â€“ command-line interface
- apt-get update :: Resynchronize the local package index files from their sources.
- apt-get upgrade :: Install the newest versions of all packages currently installed on the system.
- add-apt-repository :: Enable a repository.
- dpkg :: Package manager for Debian
- /etc/apt/sources.list :: List of configured APT data sources
- /var/log/apt/history.log :: Install history log
- Repository :: A collection of software build for a specific Linux distribution.

* Preparation

You need Sudo privileges so do this assignment in the Ubuntu virtual machine.

* Adding a Repository

Canonical, the company that sponsors Ubuntu does not support all the available software itself.  Community supported software is in a separate repository.  First you need to add that repo to the =/etc/apt/sources.list=.

: $ cat /etc/apt/sources.lists

The output shows the repositories that are enabled.  To find the program we are looking for we'll add the /Universe/ repository.

: $ sudo add-apt-repository universe 'universe' distribution component added for all sources.

Next run =apt-get update= to refresh the local package database.

* Finding a Package to Install

A co-worker mentioned that there is a real-time interactive command line process viewer like top but with a nicer interface.  However you don't know the name of the package.  Use =apt-cache= to find the correct package.

First update the local package list if not already done.

: $ sudo apt-get update

Next use =apt-cache= to find the package:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ apt-cache search "process viewer"
gnome-system-monitor - Process viewer and system resource monitor for GNOME
htop - interactive process viewer
htop looks like what we want. Let's find out more about the package.
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ apt-cache show htop

Description-en: interactive processes viewer Htop is an ncursed-based process viewer similar to top, but it allows one to scroll the list vertically and horizontally to see all processes and their full command lines.
#+END_EXAMPLE

The *show* option to =apt-cache= lists a lot more information about the program.

* Installing htop

You can install =htop= with =apt-get=.  Installing software on Ubuntu requires Sudo privileges.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ sudo apt-get install htop

APT installs =htop= along with any dependencies and installs the manpage as well.

Run the new program:

: $ htop

To find out more about htop see the manpage.

: $ man htop

* Program Version

Most programs accept the *-v* option to show the version number.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ htop -v
htop 1.0.2 - (C) 2004-2011 Hisham Muhammad
Released under the GNU GPL.
The dpkg command can also be used:

$ dpkg --list htop

#+END_EXAMPLE

* 8 Package Archive

The installed Debian archives (deb packages) are stored in the =/var= directory.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ ls /var/cache/apt/archives/ | grep htop
htop_1.0.2-1_amd64.deb
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Removing an Installed Package

APT can also remove an installed package:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ sudo apt-get remove htop
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
The following packages will be REMOVED:
htop*
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 1 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
After this operation, 188 kB disk space will be freed.
Do you want to continue [Y/n]?
#+END_EXAMPLE

The remove option will not remove any configuration files.  To remove configuration files as well use *purge*.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ sudo apt-get purge htop
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
The following packages will be REMOVED:
htop*
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 1 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
Purge htop [1.0.2-1]
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Install aptitude

Aptitude is not installed by default.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ apt-cache show aptitude
Description-en: terminal-based package manager
aptitude is a package manager with a number of useful features,
including: a mutt-like syntax for matching packages in a flexible
manner, dselect-like persistence of user actions, the ability to
retrieve and display the Debian changelog of most packages, and a
command-line mode similar to that of apt-get.

aptitude is also Y2K-compliant, non-fattening, naturally cleansing, and housebroken.
Here the -s option will simulate the installation:
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ sudo apt-get -s install aptitude
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree

The following extra packages will be installed:
aptitude-common libboost-iostreams1.49.0 libcwidget3 libept1.4.12
Suggested packages:
aptitude-doc-en aptitude-doc tasksel debtags libcwidget-dev
The following NEW packages will be installed:

* Keeping Your System Up to Date

The =apt-get update= and =apt-get upgrade= commands are used to keep a Debian system up to date.  The =apt-get dist-upgrade= will upgrade a system to the latest stable release.  /Example:/ From Squeeze to Wheezy.

* What to Submit

Submit a cropped screenshot of the last 10 lines of the history log showing that =htop= was install than uninstalled.

: $ sudo tail /var/log/apt/history.log
