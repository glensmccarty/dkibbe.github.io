<h2 id="assignment-objectives">Assignment Objectives</h2>

<p>SSH is widely used to administer remote hosts and as such is a prime target for exploitation attempts. In this assignment you will configure the SSH server for added security.</p>

<p><em>When you have successfully completed this assignment you will be able to:</em></p>

<ol>
<li>Identify the configuration file for the SSH server daemon.</li>
<li>Configure SSH to use a non-standard port.</li>
<li>Improve security be disabling remote root logins.</li>
<li>Reduce the number failed login attempts allowed.</li>
<li>Add an SSH banner.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="terms-and-concepts">Terms and Concepts</h2>

<dl>
<dt>Daemon</dt>
<dd>A background process that handles requests for services such as print spooling and is dormant when not required.</dd>

<dt>Well-Known Ports</dt>
<dd>Ports 0-1023 are reserved for common services and can only be accessed by root.</dd>

<dt><code>/etc/ssh/sshd_conf</code></dt>
<dd>Configuration file for the SSH server daemon</dd>

<dt>Netcat</dt>
<dd>Used to determine if a service is running on a port.</dd>

<dt>Nmap</dt>
<dd>Network port scanner</dd>

<dt><code>lsof</code></dt>
<dd>List open files.</dd>

<dt><code>/etc/services</code></dt>
<dd>Lists services and their default ports. This file is for information only and does no configuration itself.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>

<p>Start both a CentOS 7 and Ubuntu virtual machine or work with another student using two CentOS 7 VMs.</p>

<h3 id="networking">Networking</h3>

<ol>
<li>Make sure the virtual machines are powered off.</li>
<li>Set the network adapter in VirtualBox to <em>Bridged Network</em> and refresh the MAC address..</li>
<li>Start the CentOS virtual machine and log in as root.</li>
<li>Run <code>ip addr</code> on both VMs to confirm that the IP addresses are on the 192.168.201.0/24 network.</li>
</ol>



<h3 id="install-nmap">Install Nmap</h3>

<p>Use <code>yum</code> and <code>apt-get</code> as appropriate to install <code>nmap</code> and possibly <code>zenmap</code>.</p>

<h3 id="scanning-ports">Scanning Ports</h3>

<p>Use <code>nmap</code> to do a simple scan and you should see that port 22 is open for ssh traffic.</p>

<h2 id="connect-to-the-ssh-server">Connect to the SSH Server</h2>

<p>You should now be able to use <code>ssh</code> from the workstation to connect to the virtual machine. </p>

<p>Now connect with <code>ssh root@192.169.201.nnn</code> replacing <em>nnn</em> with the last octet of the actual IP address. The first time you connect SSH will ask you to confirm the connection.</p>

<p>After you accept the connection you should be logged in as root. Type <code>exit</code> to close the connection.</p>

<h3 id="the-ssh-server-configuration-file">The SSH Server Configuration File</h3>

<p>SSH server configuration setting are in <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_conf</code>. Like most Linux configuration files it is plain text and, at least, on CentOS is well commented. Notice that lines need to be uncommented for a change to be effective. Also, You need to reload the configuration file for changes to become effective using the <code>systemctl restart sshd.service</code> command.</p>

<h3 id="disabling-root-logins">Disabling Root Logins</h3>

<p>There is no reason for the <em>root</em> user to login directly. Root should also have an ordinary user account for that purpose and that use either <code>su</code> or <code>sudo</code> to perform root functions. This change alone can reduce attacks significantly. Change the line in the <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_conf</code> file from <strong>PermitRootLogin</strong> <em>yes</em> to <em>no</em>. <em>Note:</em> In <code>vi</code> use /Root to search for the line.</p>

<p>Restart the service and log in again as <em>root</em> this time the attempt should fail.</p>

<h3 id="change-default-port">Change Default Port</h3>

<p>SSH be default listens on port 22. You can change this by uncommenting the line <strong>port 22</strong> and changing the port number to an unused port in the <strong>registered</strong> or <strong>ephemeral</strong> range. See Wikipedia link to ports under <em>Resources</em> below.</p>

<p>Be sure to follow the instructions in the <em>sshd_config</em> to set SELinux. Use <code>yum whatprovides</code> to see what package contains <code>semanage</code>.</p>



<h4 id="open-the-port-in-the-firewall">Open the Port in the Firewall</h4>

<p>Install <code>firewalld</code>. Since port 2222 is not a standard service you need to use this command to open the port.</p>

<pre><code># firewall-cmd --add-port=2222/tcp
</code></pre>

<h4 id="disable-port-22">Disable Port 22</h4>

<p>And remove the default port.</p>

<pre><code># firewall-cmd --remove-service ssh
</code></pre>

<p>Run a <code>nmap</code> scan and there should be no "interesting" ports open.</p>

<h3 id="selinux">SELinux</h3>

<p>Use the instructions in the SSHD conf. file to configure SELinux. Use <code>yum provides</code> if needed to find the correct package to install.</p>

<p>Run a<code>nmap</code> scan on a port range that includes the oprt you opened for SSH.</p>

<pre><code>$ nmap - 2200-2250 192.168.201.nnn
</code></pre>

<h3 id="protocol">Protocol</h3>

<p>Assure that the more secure <strong>Protocol 2</strong> is being used. This is the default.</p>



<h3 id="reducing-the-number-of-login-tries">Reducing the Number of Login Tries</h3>

<p>The default is <strong>6</strong> failed attempt but you can reduce this to a smaller number by changing <strong>MaxAuthTries</strong>. Edit <strong>MaxAuthTries</strong> to allow only attempts.</p>



<h3 id="disabling-password-logins-optional">Disabling Password Logins (Optional)</h3>

<p>If you created SSH keys you can disable password logins entirely. Uncomment and change <strong>PasswordAuthentication</strong> to <em>no</em> to disable password logins. <em>Warning:</em> If you lose your SSH keys you will not be able to login.</p>

<h2 id="adding-an-ssh-banner">Adding an SSH Banner</h2>

<p>Adding a welcome banner that warns that all activity on the server is a good idea. Creating a banner text file and adding a line to the <em>sshd_config</em> file is all that is needed.</p>

<p>First create the banner using <code>vi</code> or <code>emacs</code>.</p>

<p>Leave a blank line or two below the banner text so the banner appears above the login prompt.</p>

<p>Next add this line to the <em>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</em> file.</p>

<p>Now reload the configuration file for the change to take effect.</p>



<h3 id="finally">Finally</h3>

<p>Since you can not log in as <em>root</em> create a user on the SSH server that you can log in as.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-submit">What to Submit</h2>

<p>Copy and paste these questions along with your answers into the submission text-box (not the comment box) to receive credit for this assignment.</p>

<p>Copy and paste a screenshot of the output of <code>nmap</code> or <code>netcat</code> showing ssh listening on a higher port.</p>
