<h2 id="assignment-objectives">Assignment Objectives</h2>

<p>SSH is widely used to administer remote hosts and as such is a prime target for exploitation attempts. In this assignment you will configure the SSH server for added security.</p>

<p><em>When you have successfully completed this assignment you will be able to:</em></p>

<ol>
<li>Identify the configuration file for the SSH server daemon.</li>
<li>Configure SSH to use a non-standard port.</li>
<li>Improve security be disabling remote root logins.</li>
<li>Reduce the number failed login attempts allowed.</li>
<li>Add an SSH banner.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="terms-and-concepts">Terms and Concepts</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Daemon:</strong> A background process that handles requests for services such as print spooling and is dormant when not required.</li>
<li><strong>Well-Known Ports:</strong> Ports 0-1023 are reserved for common services and can only be accessed by root.</li>
<li><strong>/etc/ssh/sshd_conf:</strong> Configuration file for the SSH server daemon</li>
<li><strong>Telnet:</strong> Used to determine if a service is running on a port.</li>
<li><strong>Nmap:</strong> Network port scanner</li>
<li><code>lsof</code>: List open files.</li>
<li><code>/etc/services</code>: Lists services and their default ports. This file is for information only and does no configuration itself.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>



<h3 id="networking">Networking</h3>

<ol>
<li>Make sure the CentOS virtual machine is powered off.</li>
<li>Set the network adapter in VirtualBox to <em>Bridged Network</em>.</li>
<li>Start the CentOS virtual machine and log in as root.</li>
<li>Run <code>ip addr</code> and confirm that the IP address is on the 192.168.201.0/24 network.</li>
</ol>

<p></p>

<h3 id="monitoring-ports">Monitoring ports</h3>

<p>CentOS-minimal does not have <code>lsof</code> or <code>nmap</code> installed by default. Use <code>yum install lsof nmap -y</code> to install both packages.</p>



<h2 id="connect-to-the-virtual-machine-from-the-workstation">Connect to the Virtual Machine from the Workstation</h2>

<p>You should now be able to use <code>ssh</code> from the workstation to connect to the virtual machine. First use <code>telnet</code> to check that SSH is running on the default port. You should see something similar to this output:</p>

<p>Typing <strong>Ctrl+]</strong> will close the connection and leave you at a Telnet prompt. Typing <strong>q</strong> will quit Telnet.</p>

<p>Now connect with <code>ssh root@192.169.201.nnn</code> replacing <em>nnn</em> with the last octet of the actual IP address. The first time you connect SSH will ask you to confirm the connection.</p>

<p>After you accept the connection you should be logged in as root. Type <code>exit</code> to close the connection.</p>

<h3 id="the-ssh-server-configuration-file">The SSH Server Configuration File</h3>

<p>SSH server configuration setting are in <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_conf</code>. Like most Linux configuration files it is plain text and, at least, on CentOS is well commented. Notice that lines need to be uncommented for a change to be effective. Also, You need to reload the configuration file for changes to become effective using the <code>service sshd reload</code> command or <code>/etc/init.d/sshd reload</code>.</p>



<h3 id="disabling-root-logins">Disabling Root Logins</h3>

<p>There is no reason for the root user to login directly. Root should also have an ordinary user account for that purpose and that use either <code>su</code> or <code>sudo</code> to perform root functions. This change alone can reduce attacks significantly. Change the line in the <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_conf</code> file from <strong>PermitRootLogin</strong> <em>yes</em> to <em>no</em>. <em>Note:</em> In <code>vi</code> use /Root to search for the line.</p>



<h3 id="change-default-port">Change Default Port</h3>

<p>SSH be default listens on port 22. You can change this by uncommenting the line <strong>port 22</strong> and changing the port number to an unused port in the <strong>registered</strong> or <strong>ephemeral</strong> range. See Wikipedia link to ports under <em>Resources</em> below.</p>

<p>Be sure to follow the instructions in the <em>sshd_config</em> to set SELinux. Use <code>yum whatprovides</code> to see what package contains <code>semanage</code>.</p>

<h3 id="protocol">Protocol</h3>

<p>Assure that the more secure <strong>Protocol 2</strong> is being used. This is the default.</p>



<h3 id="reducing-the-number-of-login-tries">Reducing the Number of Login Tries</h3>

<p>The default is <strong>6</strong> failed attempt but you can reduce this to a smaller number by changing <strong>MaxAuthTries</strong>. Edit <strong>MaxAuthTries</strong> to allow only attempts.</p>



<h3 id="disabling-password-logins">Disabling Password Logins</h3>

<p>If you created SSH keys you can disable password logins entirely. Uncomment and change <strong>PasswordAuthentication</strong> to <em>no</em> to disable password logins. <em>Warning:</em> If you lose your SSH keys you will not be able to login.</p>



<h2 id="what-to-submit">What to Submit</h2>

<p>Copy and paste these questions along with your answers into the submission text-box (not the comment box) to receive credit for this assignment.</p>

<ol>
<li>Using <code>nmap</code> what ports did you find open on CentOS-minimal?</li>
<li>What services use these ports?</li>
<li>Change <strong>PasswordAuthentication</strong> to <em>no</em> and commit the changes then use <code>ssh localhost</code> to try to login. (You’ll be using SSH from the CentOS-minimal terminal.) What error message do you get?</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="adding-an-ssh-banner">Adding an SSH Banner</h2>

<p>Adding a welcome banner that warns that all activity on the server is a good idea. Creating a banner text file and adding a line to the <em>sshd_config</em> file is all that is needed.</p>

<p>First create the banner using <code>vi</code> or <code>emacs</code>.</p>

<p>Leave a blank line or two below the banner text so the banner appears above the login prompt.</p>

<p>Next add this line to the <em>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</em> file.</p>

<p>Now reload the configuration file for the change to take effect.</p>
