<h1 id="here-documents">Here Documents</h1>

<p>A here document contained in a script can be used to deliver information when the script is run similar to the <code>echo</code> command. Here is an example from Gregâ€™s Bash Guide:</p>

<pre><code>usage() {
    cat &lt;&lt;EOF
    usage: foobar [-x] [-v] [-z] [file ...]
    A short explanation of the operation goes here.
    It might be a few lines long, but shouldn't be  excessive.
    EOF
}
</code></pre>

<p>The actual here document starts with <code>cat</code> and ends with <strong>EOF</strong>. The text between the End Of File markers is the text that is printed out. To make the here document easier to call in the script it has been wrapped in a function.</p>

<p>If the text of the here Doc is indented with Tabs. use the dash (<strong>-</strong>) option to remove them before printing.</p>

<pre><code>cat &lt;&lt;-EOF
</code></pre>

<h2 id="feeding-data-to-a-command">Feeding Data to a Command</h2>

<p>Just as text is feed to the screen using <code>cat</code> data can be input to a command the same way. A token indicating the end of the input (here EOF) is entered on a line by itself.</p>

<pre><code>ftp -n &lt;&lt; EOF
open mirrors.xmission.com
user anonymous nothinghere
ascii
cd gutenberg
get GUTINDEX.01
bye
EOF
</code></pre>

<h2 id="what-to-submit">What to Submit</h2>

<p>Add a here document to the Rock, Paper, Scissors assignment that prints usage if the wrong entry is given.</p>
