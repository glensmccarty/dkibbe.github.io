* Assignment Objectives

Managing users and groups is an important administrative skill.  In this assignment youâ€™ll add two new user accounts from the command line on a Red Hat-based virtual machine.

/After successfully completing this assignment you will be able to:/

1. Create new user accounts from the command line.
2. Add a user to supplementary groups with the usermod command.
3. Create content in the =/etc/skel/= directory that will be copied over to the user's home directory.
4. Describe the difference between a /password/ and a /passphrase/.
5. Modify system-wide login defaults.

* Terms and Commands You Should Know

- /etc/passwd :: A text file that describes user login accounts for the system.
- /etc/shadow :: A text file which contains the password information for the system's accounts and optional aging information.
- /etc/group :: A text file that defines the groups on the system.
- /etc/gshadow :: A text file which contains the password information for groups.
- /etc/login.defs :: A text file that defines the defaults for accounts.
- /etc/adduser.conf :: Configuration file for the adduser command.
- /etc/skel :: Files placed in this directory will be copied to new users home directory.
- chage :: Change user password expiry information.
- chfn :: Change real user name and information.
- finger :: Read information from a users profile (real name, phone, etc.) if they have one.
- GECOS :: A field in the =/etc/passwd= file containing the real name and contact - information for a user.
- groupadd :: Create a new group.
- groupdel :: Remove a group from the system.
- groupmod :: Modify a group account.
- id :: Print user and group information.
- passwd :: Change a user's password.
- useradd :: Add a new user to the system (Red Hat). The ~passwd~ command must also be run.
- adduser :: Add a new user to the system (Debian).
- userdel :: Remove a user.
- usermod :: Modify a user account.
- vipw :: Safely edit the /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, and /etc/group files.
- who :: Show who is logged into the system.
- id :: Print real and effective user and group IDs.
- su :: Switch to another user (always use with the - dash option.

* Preparations

1. Start a CentOS 7 virtual machine by importing the centos7.ova.
2. Create a snapshot of the virtual machine so you can roll back any errors.
3. You can find the most up to date version of this assignment on [[http://dennisk.freeshell.org/cis126dl_users.html][my web site]].

* Adding a File to /etc/skel

The =/etc/skel= directory as defined in =/etc/defaults/useradd= is the place to put any files or directories you want to be copied to a user's home directory when a new user is created.  For this assignment add a /welcome.txt/ file (it can be an empty file) to the =/etc/skel= directory so it will copied to the home directories of the new accounts you create.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# touch /etc/skel/welcome.txt
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Changing the Maximum Days a Password May Be Used

The =/etc/login.defs= file sets defaults for creating user accounts such as when passwords expire.  Find the line that reads *PASSMAXDAYS 99999* and change it to *PASSMAXDAYS 90* using the ~vi~ or ~vim~ text editor.  Be sure you create a backup before you edit the file.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# cd
# cp /etc/login.defs login.defs.bak
# vi /etc/login.defs
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Creating New Users

Use the ~useradd~ command to create two new accounts.

** First Account

Create a new account with the login of *jstudent* with the password *Pa$$w0rd*.  Use the *-c* option to add *Jill Student* to the GECOS field.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# useradd -c "Jill Student" jstudent
#+END_EXAMPLE

Run the ~grep~ command and note that the account is locked indicated by the *!!* in the second field since a password has not been set yet.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# grep jstudent /etc/shadow
#+END_EXAMPLE

Next set a password for the account.  The password you use doesn't not meet the security guides set but as root you can over-ride them.  An ordinary user would not be able to set this password.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# passwd jstudent
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Second Account

Create a second new account with the login *trillian* and the passphrase *Heart of Gold*.  A passphrase can be more secure than a password since a passphrase can contain spaces and longer passphrases can be more easily remembered.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# useradd -c "Tricia McMillan, Starship Heart of Gold" trillian
# passwd trillian
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Showing the Accounts

Most account information is kept in the =/etc/passwd= file.  The ~tail~ command will show the two new account entries at the end of the file.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# tail /etc/passwd
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Add a Supplemental Group

Run ~id trillian~ to show that Trillian is the member of only her own private group.

Next add Trillian to the /wheel/ supplementary group.  On most Linux distributions the /wheel/ group allows a user to run administrative commands using ~sudo~.Be sure to use the capital *-G* option.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# usermod -aG wheel trillian
#+END_EXAMPLE

After adding Trillian to the wheel group her login name will show in the =/etc/group= file twice.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# grep trillian /etc/group
wheel:x:4:trillain
trillian:x:1001:
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Modify Account Expiration

Change the account expiration to *120 days* from today.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# chage -l trillian
# sudo chage -E YYYY-MM-DD trillian
# chage -l trillian
#+END_EXAMPLE

* On Your Own

Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu use the ~adduser~ command to create accounts and set the password in one step.  Create the same accounts that you did above on Ubuntu or another Debian-based distribution.

* COMMENT XKCD

* What to Submit

Submit a single, cropped screenshot of the following:

- The output of ~id jstudent~
- The output of ~id trillian~
- The output of ~chage -l trillian~

Your screenshot must show that:

1. Both accounts were created.
2. That Trillian belongs to the wheel group in addition to her own private group.
3. That password must to be renewed in 90 days and that Triliian's account expires in approx. 120 days.
