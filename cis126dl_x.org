  Do this assignment on the workstation.

* Virtual Terminals

  Outside the glaring graphical facade of the desktop is the inky blackness that is the virtual terminal.  There are six *Ctrl+Alt+F1* to *Ctrl+Alt+F6* with *Ctrl+Alt+F7* returning you to the GUI.  Some distros swap *F7* and *F1* putting the GUI on *F1*.  If there is some program locking up the browser (Flash comes to mind) you can abandon the GUI and swiftly dispatch the offender from a virtual terminal.

  1. Type *Ctrl+Alt+F1* to go to the first virtual terminal.

  2. Log in with your user name and password.  Unlike the GUI the terminal does not show and character when you type your password.

  3. Type =w= to list the users logged in.  You will see that you are logged in twice.

  4. Type *Ctrl+Alt+F7* to return to the GUI.

* Starting Another Desktop

  Linux can have multiple desktops running at once.

  1. Type *Ctrl+Alt+F1* to reach a virtual terminal.

  2. Type =startx -- :1= which will start a new desktop on *Ctrl+Alt+F8*.

  3. Type *Ctrl+Alt+F7* to see your main desktop.

  4. Type *Ctrl+Alt+F8* and you out.  You will be returned to the virtual terminal where you launched the desktop.

  5. Try to start =mousepad=.  You can't because Mousepad is a graphical program

  6. Start X (capital) =X :1&=.  The ampersand places the program in the background so you can start other programs from the prompt.

  7. A new display starts on *Ctrl+Alt+F8*.  This is just the xorg graphical server -- nothing but a black screen.

  8. Type *Ctrl+Alt+F1* to return to the virtual terminal 1.

  9. Start =mousepad= on display 1 =mousepad --display :1&=

  10. Go to *Ctrl+Alt+F8*.  Mousepad is running but you can't move it around or resize it.

  11. Start =xfce4-about= on display 1 =xfce4-about --display :1&=

  12. About XFCE obstructs Mousepad and again you can't move it around or resize it.  You need a way to manage windows.

* Window Maker
  
  Window Maker is a simple window manager that, well, manages windows.  Start it on display 1

  : wmaker --display :1&

  Now return to the desktop and you'll something much different.  You can access a menu by right clicking the desktop.

  When you are finished close About XFCE but leave Mousepad open. Select *Session, Exit* from the Window Maker menu to close Window Maker.  Notice you can no longer move or resize Mousepad.
