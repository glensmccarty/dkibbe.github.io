# The Nano Text Editor

## Custom Nano Configuration

If `~/.nanorc` exists `nano` will read it and use the custom configuration it finds. There is already sample configuration file that you can use as a template.

1. Open `/usr/share/doc/nano/example/nanorc.sample.gz` in Gedit. Since it's a compressed file you can't use `vi` or `nano`. 
2. Copy the file to your home directory as `.nanorc
3. Edit the file as needed.
