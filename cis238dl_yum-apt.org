* Install a Package From a Software Repository

  You've heard that there is a user-friendly command line file manager for CentOS but you don't know the name of the package.  The first step is to use =yum search= to search for the package.

#+BEGIN_SOURCE bash
$ yum search file manager
========== N/S Matched: file, manager ==========
mc.x86_64 : User-friendly text console file manager and visual shell
#+END_SOURCE

Now that you have the package name you can find more information using =yum info mc=.

#+BEGIN_SOURCE bash
$ yum info mc
#+END_SOURCE

The output of that command will give a lot of information about the package including a short description, version number and file size, which repo the package is in, license informantion and where to find more about the package.

#+BEGIN_SOURCE bash
$ yum install mc
#+END_SOURCE

Yum will install the package, a manual page and any dependencies needed.  Whenever there is a security fix or update for the MC package the package management system will take care of it automatically.

* RPM

While the =rpm= command can install packages on a Red Hat-based system it does not handle dependencies so =yum= is prefered for installations.

For a complete list of installed pacakges:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE bash
$ rpm -qa | less
#+END_SOURCE

To find the version number of a single package:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE bash
$ rpm -q mc
#+END_SOURCE

To list the files belonging to a package:

#+BEGIN_SOURCE bash
$ rpm -ql mc
#+END_SOURCE
