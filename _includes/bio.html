<p>I have been teaching the Linux Operating System since 2008 at Mesa Community College and have been working with Linux for well over a decade. In 2009 I was a contributing author to <em>The Command Line</em> for GNU Press and have served as a subject matter expert for other publishers. Two of my courses have received Mesa Community Collegeâ€™s Gold Star certification for instructional excellence. I hold numerous industry certifications including the CompTIA Linux+, the Linux Professional Institute LPIC-1, SUSE Certified Linux Administrator and CompTIA Security+.</p>
