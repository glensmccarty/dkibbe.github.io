* Overview

systemd replaces the SysV init scripts for starting services on a Linux system.  While controversial it has become the default on nearly all major Linux distributions.  systemd has these features.

- Based on C Groups
- Parallel startup of services
- Faster boot
- On demand startup of services
- systemd units
- Socket-based activation

* Assignment Objectives

/When you have successfully completed this assignment you will be able to:/

- Describe the advantages of systemd
- Use =systemctl= to start and stop a service.
- Use =systemctl= to change the target.
- Use =journalctl= to list log entries.

* Terms You Should Know

- =systemctl= :: Main command for working with systemd.
- =/etc/systemd/system/= :: Systemd units created and managed by the system administrator.  Takes precedence over the directory with runtime units.
- =/run/systemd/system/= :: Contains systemd units created at run time.  Takes precedence over the directory with installed service units.
- =/usr/lib/systemd/system/= :: Contains systemd units shipped with the operating system.
- systemd units :: Contain information about system services, listening sockets, saved system state snapshots, and other objects that are relevant to the init system.

* Preparation

Use the CentOS 7 minimal installation for this assignment.

* Services

** List all Services

The =systemctl= command is used to list, start and stop services.

: systemctl list-units --type service --all

** List All Currently Loaded Services

: systemctl list-units --type service

** COMMENT Is That Service Enabled?

Enabling a service makes it available on reboot.

: systemctl list-unit-files --type service

** Is Service Active?

Is the service running?

: systemctl is-active name.service

** Check the Status of a Service

: systemctl status dbus.service

** Start, Stop and Reload a Service

: systemctl start httpd.service
: systemctl stop httpd.service
: systemctl reload httpd.service

** Enable a Service on Boot

This command replaces the =chkconfig= command.

: systemctl enable httpd.service

** Disable a Service on Boot

: systemctl disable httpd.service

* Working with Targets

systemd replaces runlevels with targets.

** Default Target

Target replace *runlevels*.  The default runlevel is multi-user.

: systemctl get-default

** Currently Loaded Targets

: systemctl list-units --type target

** Rescue Target

: systemctl rescue

Return to the multi-user target with this command.

: systemctl default

** Emergency Target

: systemctl emergency

** Stopping the System

: systemctl poweroff

** Reboot the System

: systemctl reboot

** COMMENT Controlling systemd Remotely

systemd can be used to control a host remotely.

: systemctl --host user_name@host_name command

** Log Files

This command reads the log files from a previous boot.

: journalctl --boot=-1
